I generated associated information to get an idea on which political parties and which presidents created these monouments.</span><p /><span>The information below provides how many monuments were created by each party, by each president and information about each monument.  The authorization for the President to designate National Monuments was authorized in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_Act" target="_blank">1906 Antiquities Act</a> and there have been 129 National Monuments created since that time.</span><p /><span>Within the information about each National Monument, you can find:</span>
